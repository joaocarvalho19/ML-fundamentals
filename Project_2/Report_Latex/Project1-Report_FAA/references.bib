ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to construct machine learning (ML) models for predicting prolonged length of stay (pLOS) in intensive care units (ICU) among general ICU patients. A multicenter database called eICU (Collaborative Research Database) was used for model derivation and internal validation, and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database was used for external validation. We used four different ML methods (random forest, support vector machine, deep learning, and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)) to develop prediction models. The prediction performance of the four models were compared with the customized simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II. The area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), estimated calibration index (ECI), and Brier score were used to measure performance. In internal validation, the GBDT model achieved the best overall performance (Brier score, 0.164), discrimination (AUROC, 0.742; AUPRC, 0.537), and calibration (ECI, 8.224). In external validation, the GBDT model also achieved the best overall performance (Brier score, 0.166), discrimination (AUROC, 0.747; AUPRC, 0.536), and calibration (ECI, 8.294). External validation showed that the calibration curve of the GBDT model was an optimal fit, and four ML models outperformed the customized SAPS II model. The GBDT-based pLOS-ICU prediction model had the best prediction performance among the five models on both internal and external datasets. Furthermore, it has the potential to assist ICU physicians to identify patients with pLOS-ICU risk and provide appropriate clinical interventions to improve patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Various factors are behind the forces that drive hospitals toward more sustainable operations. Hospitals contracting with Medicare, for instance, are reimbursed for the procedures performed, regardless of the number of days that patients stay in the hospital. This reimbursement structure has incentivized hospitals to use their resources (such as their beds) more efficiently to maximize revenues. One way hospitals can improve bed utilization is by predicting patients’ length of stay (LOS) at the time of admission, the benefits of which extend to employees, communities, and the patients themselves. In this paper, we employ a data analytics approach to develop and test a deep learning neural network to predict LOS for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. The theoretical contribution of our effort is that it identifies variables related to patients’ prior admissions as important factors in the prediction of LOS in hospitals, thereby revising the current paradigm in which patients’ medical histories are rarely considered for the prediction of LOS. The methodological contributions of our work include the development of a data engineering methodology to augment the data sets, prediction of LOS as a numerical (rather than a binary) variable, temporal evaluation of the training and validation data sets, and a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting LOS for COPD and pneumonia inpatients. Our evaluations show that variables related to patients’ previous admissions are the main driver of the deep network’s superior performance in predicting the LOS as a numerical variable. Using the assessment criteria introduced in prior studies (i.e., ±2 days and ±3 days tolerance), our models are able to predict the length of hospital stay with 86 \% and 91 \% accuracy for the COPD data set, and with 74 \% and 85 \% accuracy for the pneumonia data set. Hence, our effort could help hospitals serve a larger number of patients with a fixed amount of resources, thereby reducing their environmental footprint while increasing their revenue, as well as their patients’ satisfaction.}

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) applications are making a considerable impact on healthcare. ML is a subtype of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that aims to improve the speed and accuracy of physicians' work. Countries are currently dealing with an overburdened healthcare system with a shortage of skilled physicians, where AI provides a big hope. The healthcare data can be used gainfully to identify the optimal trial sample, collect more data points, assess ongoing data from trial participants, and eliminate data-based errors. ML-based techniques assist in detecting early indicators of an epidemic or pandemic. This algorithm examines satellite data, news and social media reports, and even video sources to determine whether the sickness will become out of control. Using ML for healthcare can open up a world of possibilities in this field. It frees up healthcare providers' time to focus on patient care rather than searching or entering information. This paper studies ML and its need in healthcare, and then it discusses the associated features and appropriate pillars of ML for healthcare structure. Finally, it identified and discussed the significant applications of ML for healthcare. The applications of this technology in healthcare operations can be tremendously advantageous to the organisation. ML-based tools are used to provide various treatment alternatives and individualised treatments and improve the overall efficiency of hospitals and healthcare systems while lowering the cost of care. Shortly, ML will impact both physicians and hospitals. It will be crucial in developing clinical decision support, illness detection, and personalised treatment approaches to provide the best potential outcomes.}

    abstract = {Hospital length of stay of patients is a crucial factor for the effective planning and management of hospital resources. There is considerable interest in predicting the LoS of patients in order to improve patient care, control hospital costs and increase service efficiency. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature, examining the approaches employed for the prediction of LoS in terms of their merits and shortcomings. In order to address some of these problems, a unified framework is proposed to better generalise the approaches that are being used to predict length of stay. This includes the investigation of the types of routinely collected data used in the problem as well as recommendations to ensure robust and meaningful knowledge modelling. This unified common framework enables the direct comparison of results between length of stay prediction approaches and will ensure that such approaches can be used across several hospital environments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from 1970 until 2019 to identify LoS surveys which review the literature. 32 Surveys were identified, from these 32 surveys, 220 papers were manually identified to be relevant to LoS prediction. After removing duplicates, and exploring the reference list of studies included for review, 93 studies remained. Despite the continuing efforts to predict and reduce the LoS of patients, current research in this domain remains ad-hoc; as such, the model tuning and data preprocessing steps are too specific and result in a large proportion of the current prediction mechanisms being restricted to the hospital that they were employed in. Adopting a unified framework for the prediction of LoS could yield a more reliable estimate of the LoS as a unified framework enables the direct comparison of length of stay methods. Additional research is also required to explore novel methods such as fuzzy systems which could build upon the success of current models as well as further exploration of black-box approaches and model interpretability.},

    abstract = {Data Mining (DM) aims at the extraction of useful knowledge from raw data. In the last decades, hospitals
have collected large amounts of data through new methods of electronic data storage, thus increasing the
potential value of DM in this domain area, in what is known as medical data mining. This work focuses on
the case study of a Portuguese hospital, based on recent and large dataset that was collected from 2000 to
2013. A data-driven predictive model was obtained for the length of stay (LOS), using as inputs indicators
commonly available at the hospitalization process. Based on a regression approach, several state-of-the-art
DM models were compared. The best result was obtained by a Random Forest (RF), which presents a high
quality coefficient of determination value (0.81). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis approach was used to extract
human understandable knowledge from the RF model, revealing top three influential input attributes: hospital
episode type, the physical service where the patient is hospitalized and the associated medical specialty. Such
predictive and explanatory knowledge is valuable for supporting decisions of hospital managers.},
